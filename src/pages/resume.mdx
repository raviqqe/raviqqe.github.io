## Open Source Projects

### [Pen][pen] (Rust)

- The functional programming language inspired by [Go](https://go.dev/)'s philosophy.
- Automatic thread-safe memory management by [the Perceus reference counting algorithm](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/perceus-tr-v1.pdf).
  - ["How to Implement the Perceus Reference Counting Garbage Collection"](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-implement-the-perceus-reference-counting-garbage-collection) on Hackernoon.
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI) against Rust supporting both non-`async` and `async` functions using proc macros and the C ABI.

### [F\-\-](https://github.com/raviqqe/fmm) (Rust)

- Compiler infrastructure and its intermediate language for functional programming languages inspired by [C-- in Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/rts/cmm).
- Supports compilation of the intermediate language into both [LLVM IR][llvm] and C.

### [Turtle](https://github.com/raviqqe/turtle-build) (Rust)

- A [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)-compatible build system for high-level programming languages.
- Asynchronous task execution and scheduling integrated with [Tokio][tokio] runtime.

### [Melior](https://github.com/raviqqe/melior) (Rust)

- The rustic [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) bindings for Rust.
- Automatic API generation by proc macros and [TableGen](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/) (WIP.)

### [Stak](https://github.com/raviqqe/stak) (Rust, Scheme)

- A Scheme virtual machine and ahead-of-time bytecode compiler based on [Ribbit Scheme](https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit/tree/main).
- No `alloc` and no `std`.
- Designed to run on a machine stack as well as on heap.
  - Small memory footprints (~ a few kilobytes.)
- Performance comparable with [Gambit Scheme](http://gambitscheme.org/).

### [Schemat][schemat] (Rust)

- The blazingly fast Scheme code formatter.
- Built with [the new allocator API](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html) (available only in nightly Rust as of August 2023) for arena memory allocation in parsing and formatting algorithms.

### [Muffet](https://github.com/raviqqe/muffet) (Go)

- The fast website link checker.
- Parallel check of URL liveness using goroutines and channels.
